<h1>The Best Movies According to Dave</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all time </h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Fast and Furious Saga</h3> 
<p>This is a very exciting movie, 
packed with just enough adrenaline to keep you on the edge of your seat.
I highly reccomend it</p>

<h3>Frozen </h3>
<p>A disney animation but a masterpiece nonetheless<br /> 
this animation really opens your eyes to the importance of accepting who you are<br />
 </p>

<h3>Tenet</h3>
<p>Now this movie was absolutely bonkers drove me near mad, 
but i reccomend it<br /> 
if you like to think and solve complex puzzles</p>

<h3>Avengers</h3>
<p>Its the MCU need i say more, 
although i'm a DC stan all the way, but when you are good you are good<br /> 
no one can take it away<br />
</p>

<h3>Weathering with you </h3>
<p>I am not really emotional most times, but anime brings that side of me out 
and this is one of the most emotional anime i ever saw<br /> 
it is absolute gold i tell you<br />
